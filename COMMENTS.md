This has been a really excited excercise and, despite I couldn't spend all the time I would like, overall I'm very happy with the result.

In the repository, I left a mock data file with 1000 lines only to make numbers easy to read but please, feel free to modify and increase the lines in order to test it with high numbers. I tested it with 200k lines and it was working well.

Aditionally, I've added 3 buttons in the front-end to increase the different type of logs into the file directly in order to test the live update.

As it is a technical test, I tried to simplify the app as much as possible. For real-life app I would probably structure the components differently.

I would be very happy to hear some feedbacks.

Thanks for the opportunity and the time during this interview.

## Improvements

Some improvements that can easily be done are:

* Filter functionality.

* Sorting functionality by date or type.

## ToDo

* Testing. I didn't have much time to complete the testing units. They need to be added.
